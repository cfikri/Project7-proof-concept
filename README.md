This project is a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** on a completely open topic.

I chose to work on **time series data**, a type of data I had never worked with before.

The dataset used is the [MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset](https://www.physionet.org/files/mitdb/1.0.0/mitdbdir/intro.htm), which contains **over 100,000 annotated ECG excerpts**, originally recorded at a hospital in Boston between 1975 and 1979.

The goal of the PoC was to demonstrate that it is possible to **classify a relatively large time series dataset more efficiently and faster using a CNN (transfer learning) or InceptionTime**, compared to an **optimized random forest**.

**Main skills involved:**

- Manipulation and transformation of time series data
- Converting time series data into images
- Implementing and optimizing various neural networks (CNN, LSTM)
- Creating a dashboard with Streamlit
